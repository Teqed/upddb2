# upddb2
 This is a prototype of a tool that uses Electron to provide an interface for updating files on DB2.
 
 Primarily, this is to test Electron boilerplates and prepare a graphical interface for some other underlying tools I'm working on.
 
 This is probably not useful to anyone in its current state and is just for educational purposes so far.
